  <dt>GitFlow</dt>
  <dd>GitFlow is the structure by Git which operates. The idea behind it is to have multiple paths,
  or branches, which can be developed independently from the master branch. This allows the 
  development of new features and fixes to be developed without interferring with the master branch.
  Once the features or fixes are ready to go they can be merged back into the master branch which
  promotes seamless collaboration.</dd>
