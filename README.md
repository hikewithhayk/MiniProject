### Section 1 definitions

<dl>
  <dt>cd</dt>
  <dd>cd is a Terminal/Command Line command used to switch between folders in a directory</dd>

  <dd> <b> cd foldername </b> goes to a particular folder name </dd>

### Section 2 definitions

<dl>
  <dt>GitFlow</dt>
  <dd>GitFlow is the structure by Git which operates. The idea behind it is to have multiple paths,
  or branches, which can be developed independently from the master branch. This allows the 
  development of new features and fixes to be developed without interferring with the master branch.
  Once the features or fixes are ready to go they can be merged back into the master branch which
  promotes seamless collaboration.</dd>
  
  <dt>Repository</dt>
  <dd>A repository, also reffered to as "repo", is a directory that houses one of your projects.
  Here is where you will store your code, text files, images and other data. A repo can live 
  localy on your computer or it can be on a remote host like GitHub</dd>
  
  <dd> <b> git init </b> initializes a repository </dd>
  
  <dt>Clone</dt>
  <dd>Git clone is a command used to copy an existing repository onto a target local repository. One way
  this can be helpful is if you find a remote repository and wish to copy parts of it into your own.</dd>
  
  <dd> <b> git clone repository_url  </b> copies the targeted repository into your current one </dd>
  
  <dt>Fork</dt>
  <dd>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking is useful for collaborating with others because
  they can make changes to your project without affecting it directly.</dd>
  
  <dt>Branch</dt>
  <dd>Git allows one to branch-off from the main project in order to work on a feature or fix without getting
  in the way of the main project. It allows one to make changes without disrupting the master branch 
  and and thus avoiding conflict issues.</dd>
